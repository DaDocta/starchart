    "about": "I pride myself as a problem solver and a leader. One of my past jobs was a go-kart mechanic at Full Throttle, where I developed problem-solving skills by finding creative ways to fix the karts. I also play varsity soccer, which has shaped me into a leader for underclassmen players. Additionally, I am involved with Young Life, hosting about 60 underclassmen at my house and setting an example by performing skits for them.",
